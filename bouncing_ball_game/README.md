Prompts that I used:

/// Create the canvas + bouncing ball ///

- I want to create a 2D game with only html, css and javascript.
First I want a canvas and a bouncing ball inside the canvas. Can you help me create?

/// Create the rectangular blocks ///

- Can you give me a code that creates 7 layers of rectangular blocks?
- I want 6 columns and 7 rows of rectangular bloicks.
-> if still not 6 * 7 blocks, reorder 'I want to create total 42 blocks with 6 columns and 7 rows.'

/// Bouncing ball bounces off if it hits the rectangular blocks ///

- I want the bouncing ball to bounce off in the opposite diurection if the bouncing ball hits on the rectangular block.

/// Blocks to be disappeared when it gets hit by the bouncing ball. ///

- I want the blocks to be disappeared when it collides with the bouncing ball. Can you add that to existing codes? 

/// Creat the paddle ///

- Can I make another rectangular block on the bottom line of the canvas which I will use as a paddle? I hope the paddle can be moved horizontally by keyboard.

/// Score counter ///

- Can I count a score when the bouncing ball collides with a block which is not a paddle?

/// Color effect ///

- I want the ball to be blue in colour with the glowing effect.
- Can I change the colour of the blocks which is not paddle? I want them to be random in colour.
- Can I make the canvas colour to black?

/// Extra prompts ///

- Where should I put the code in my existing code?
-> chatGPT will help you combine the code.
- continue
-> if chatGPT stops in the middle of providing codes, then just type continue.
